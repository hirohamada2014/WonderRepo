# WonderRepo

A curated repository for building **WhirlyOS Linux**, based on Debian.

WhirlyOS wraps a Linux base in a playful, ADHD-aware shell‚Äîcomplete with simple interfaces, and seamless access to browser-based learning tools across desktop and embedded platforms. It has the features of the screen time limit to keep you free from distraction and be healthy. 

> **Warning:** The work on WhirlyOS is still ongoing, so please stay tuned for the first release of v1.0.
There are problems while I'm trying to build the disk image in GitHub Codespaces, but don't worry, I'm trying to do my best.

## üé¨ Motto

It is not an official Disney or Pixar tagline and is safe to use.
